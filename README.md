# Survey form with React

This weeks assignment was to build a survey using React.

## The problem

First I had to decide what the survey was going to be about and later sketch up how the component structure looks like. I tried to make the survey easy to adjust depending on, for example, want different describing words or captions by using the map method. 

If I had more time I would probably make it so each question is showed one at a time and progress by clicking the "Next" button.
